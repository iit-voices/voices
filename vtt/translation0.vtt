00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Boder>This is Spool 43 taken from Mr. Henry Sochami, 38 years old, tattoo number 109752 triangle, meaning Jewish, a tattoo of the camp of Auschwitz.</v>

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Boder>...He will speak Spanish, he can speak German but it's rather... slow, and we prefer to use the language he can speak most fluently.</v>

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:44.492
<v Boder>[In Spanish] Er... Mr. Sochami, tell me where you were born, and what your nationality is.</v>

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:46.665
<v Sochami> I am Greek.</v>

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Boder>Yes?</v>

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.929
<v Sochami>[Unintelligible]</v>

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:49.309
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00.50.335
<v Sochami>[Unintelligible]</v>

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.504
<v Boder>Right. And where were you born?</v>

00:00:53.504  --> 00:00:54.682
<v Sochami>In Salonica.</v>

00:00:54.682  --> 00:00:55.485
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:0055.485 --> 00:00:57.676
<v Sochami>We were later deported...</v>

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:11.982
<v Boder>Er... I would like you to tell me where you were when the Germans arrived, er... in the city where you resided.</v>

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:17.282
<v Sochami>Before the arrival of the Germans, I was in Albany, acting as a Greek soldier.</v>

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:23.759
<v Boder>So you were in the Greek Army. And who were you fighting against?</v>

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.347
<v Sochami>Against Italy.</v>

00:00:85.347 --> 00:01:30.224
<v Boder>All right. Greece joined forces with England and the United States...</v>

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:31.311
<v Sochami>The United States, yes.</v>

00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:36.007
<v Boder>So you were fighting against Italy. And, what happened?</v>

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.112
<v Sochami>I was eight months in combat.</v>

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:44.959
<v Boder>In what force were you enlisted?</v>

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Sochami>I was in class 19...</v>

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.384
<v Boder>No, no. What force did you belong to? Infantry...</v>

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:55.831
<v Sochami>Oh, the name was [unintelligible] télégraphiqué.</v>

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.928
<v Boder>Oh! You were in... [unintelligible]?</v>

00:01:58.928 --> 00:01:59.278
<v Sochami>Yes.</v>

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:00.968
<v Boder>And you know [unintelligible]?</v>

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:01.451
<v Sochami>No.</v>

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:01.904
<v Boder>You don't?</v>

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:03.944
<v Sochami>I played the clairon.</v>

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Boder>Ah!</v>

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Sochami>The bugle.</v>

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:16.186
<v Boder>So, You were the... er... bugler in... er... a telegraphic station.</v>

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:16.566
<v Sochami>Yes. Télégraphiqué.</v>

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:17.592
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:18.739
<v Sochami>[Inintelegible]</v>

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.478
<v Boder>So, could we say you are a musician?</v>

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:20.858
<v Sochami>Yes.</v>

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:23.001
<v Boder>Er, what instruments do you play?</v>

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:24.057
<v Sochami>The bugle.</v>

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:26.261
<v Boder>So you play the bugle.</v>

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:32.949
<v Sochami>Then. When the Germans declared the war against Greece.</v>

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:33.704
<v Boder>Yes.</v>

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:38.038
<v Sochami> I was fighting in Albany against Italians.</v>

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:39.275
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:02:39.275 --> 00:03:00.716
<v Sochami>Then, when my city... Salonica, was occupied by Germans, we fought in Athens, and all the places of the Old Greece.</v>

Later, we were forced to surrender to the German forces, and Germans escorted us to our houses.</v>

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:02.225
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.817
<v Sochami>I went to my house and took my three children.</v>

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:06.982
<v Boder>What was the name of the city?</v>

00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:07.845
<v Sochami>It was Salonica.</v>

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.441
<v Boder>Salonica. And were you with your wife?</v>

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:10.851
<v Sochami>Yes.</v>

00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:14.141
<v Boder>Your wife and three children. How old were they?</v>

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:24.644
<v Sochami>One was 13 years old, [unintelligible name] Sochami; the second one was 10 years old, [unintelligible name] Sochami; and the third one, Dora Sochami, was 3 years old.</v>

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:25.761
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:33.083
<v Sochami>Then, when the Germans arrived, they took all the Jews and sent us to a camp...</v>

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:34.580
<v Boder>Yes. To Auschwitz?</v>

00:03:34.580 -->00:03:36.530
<v Sochami>No, no. Before that.</v>

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.415
<v Sochami>We were taken to a labor camp.</v>

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:40.351
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:44.413
<v Sochami>Those of us between 17 and 45 years of age.</v>

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:44.896
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:45.802
<v Sochami>They took us...</v>

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:47.178
<v Boder>Men and women?</v>

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:48.295
<v Sochami>No, just men.</v>

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:48.736
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:54.277
<v Sochami>Our names were written down, and we were given some signs. We were called by position.</v>

00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:54.639
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.816
<v Sochami>Shared.</v>

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:56.299
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:56.299 -->00:03:58.442
<v Sochami>And we had to work.</v>

00:03:58.442 --> 00:03:59.227
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:06.398
<v Sochami>After working there, we were taken to... er... some railways... to guard them.</v>

00:04:06.398 --> 00:04:07.364
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:12.392
<v Sochami>After that, we were taken to a ghetto to sleep.</v>

00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:13.599
<v Boder>To sleep?</v>

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Sochami>To sleep, in the train station.</v>

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.624
<v Sochami>In Greece.</v>

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:16.956
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:20.789
<v Sochami>We were locked in the ghetto and we remained there for eight days.</v>

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:21.363
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:27.297
<v Sochami>After those eight days, three thousand five hundred people were sent...</v>

00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:28.915
<v Boder>Men and women?</v>

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:30.563
<v Sochami>Men and women and children.</v>

00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:31.275
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:33.388
<v Sochami>To the closed railway cars.</v>

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:41.694
<v Boder>So. As you were saying, you worked only with men... So where were your wife and the girls?</v>

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:48.093
<v Sochami>When we left San Nico, it was the 15th of March, 1943.</v>

00:04:48.093 --> 00:04:49.318
<v Boder>Who were you with?</v>

00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:52.004
<v Sochami>With my family.</v>

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:52.789
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.962
<v Sochami>Yes. We arrived in Auschwitz.</v>

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:56.006
<v Boder>At Auschwitz?</v>

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:59.598
<v Sochami>We got to the station on March 21.</v>

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:00.854
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Sochami>There, there was a selection... officails...</v>

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.003
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:10.910
<v Sochami>...German officials, separated children, women and old people to one place...</v>

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.544
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.502
<v Sochami>...from those who could work in another area.</v>

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:15.214
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:22.277
<v Sochami>Children, women and old people were placed in trucks and sent to Birkenau.</v>

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:22.796
<v Boder>To Birkenau?</v>

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:23.883
<v Sochami>Birkenau.</v>

00:05:23.883 --> 00:05:24.505
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:35.328
<v Sochami>Once there, they were sent to the gas chamber, directly... almost with no difficulties.</v>

The following morning, none of them were alive.</v>

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:37.308
<v Boder>Did this happen to your family?</v>

00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:42.849
<v Sochami>Yes. To all my family: three children and my wife.</v>

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:43.453
<v Boder>Oh.</v>

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:49.266
<v Sochami>We were then sent to Auschwitz. Once in Auschwitz, we were left in the bathrooms all night long.</v>

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:49.797
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:53.811
<v Sochami>We were washed, our clothes were taken away.</v>

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:54.505
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:59.002
<v Sochami>We were given prisoner’s clothes, and we were placed under quarantine for forty days.</v>

00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:00.994
<v Boder>What did you do while you were in quarantine?</v>

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:05.733
<v Sochami>During the quarantine period, we were taken outside to do some physical exercise...</v>

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:06.807
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:18.638
<v Sochami>And that was it. After the forty days had passed, some officers came to see us.</v>

They selected all those men who were strong and working men, and sent them out of Auschwitz, to other labor camps.</v>

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:19.091
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Sochami>I stayed in Auschwitz.</v>

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.377
<v Boder>What happened to those who could not work?</v>

00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:31.303
<v Sochami>Those who could not work were taken to a hospital... er... from the hospital, they were taken to Birkenau, to the crematorium.</v>

00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:31.834
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:38.263
<v Sochami>And as for those of us who could work, we were sent to labor camps or commands nearby.</v>

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:38.945
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:44.106
<v Sochami>In the commands . . . we were left aside, beaten...</v>

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:44.921
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:49.768
<v Sochami>And our food was a piece of bread with a liter of water.</v>

00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:51.971
<v Boder>What command did you work in?</v>

00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:53.843
<v Sochami>In the [unintelligible].</v>

00:06:53.843 --> 00:06:55.521
<v Boder>And what did you do there?</v>

00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:57.272
<v Sochami>There, we practiced masonry.</v>

00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:57.924
<v Boder>What?</v>

00:06:57.924 --> 00:06:58.516
<v Sochami>Masonry.</v>

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:01.009
<v Boder>Oh, you cut stone blocks?</v>

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.860
<v Sochami>Yes. Stones... with civilians who worked with us.</v>

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.263
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:15.985
<v Boder>There was a little interruption.</v>

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:27.726
<v Sochami>A month before the Russians' arrival, the camp was evacuated and we were sent to a camp in [unintelligible name].</v>

In [unintelligible name], there were only forty Jews, and the rest of the prisoners were Christian.</v>

00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:29.887
<v Boder>Could you please speak a little bit slower?</v>

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:55.608
<v Sochami>Christians battered us because they could not stand the mere sight of us.</v>

They would walk away from us, they would beat us, and they would even take our bread which was our only food.</v>

From there, before the Russians came, we were taken to Buchenwald.</v>

We were forced in cattle railcars and we were locked there for three days and three nights, with no food and nothing to drink. Nothing.</v>

00:07:55.608 --> 0:07:57.962
<v Boder>Do you remember what month it was?</v>

00:07:57.962 --> 00:08:03.033
<v Sochami>Er... It was February of 1945.</v>

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:07.035
<v Boder>February of 1945. All right.</v>

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:38.126
<v Sochami>We were taken to Buchenwald.</v>

There were sixty five to seventy thousand people under the same roof, from all nationalities, French, Italians... all the nationalities in the world.</v>

We were in a building for some time, and then there was a selection and all those who were strong enough were taken to camps all around Germany for forced labors.</v>

I would always hid under beds, or anywhere to avoid being taken to labor camps.</v>

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:43.197
<v Boder>Oh! So it was possible to hide sometimes, wasn’t it?</v>

00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.241
<v Sochami>It was sometimes possible.</v>

00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:48.195
<v Boder>It was sometimes possible. Speak more slowly please.</v>

00:08:48.195 --> 00:09:32.930
<v Sochami>From there, I was taken to a small camp. In that small camp, I was in a barrack hut with 1,200-1,300 people.</v>

There were 7 or 8 people per square meter. At ten in the morning, we were given a liter of water and a piece of bread.</v>

Three months later, Americans were approaching and every afternoon Jews were gathered to be taken away. Christians were not taken away, but Jews were.</v>

I would hide anywhere, and I even lived among Christians and they did not know I was a Jew.</v>

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:38.001
<v Boder>Did you carry anything that distinguished you as Jews?</v>

00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:43.784
<v Sochami>In Auschwitz, we carried a sign as Jews, but when we were in Buchenwald we did not have anything.</v>

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:44.677
<v Boder>OK.</v>

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:45.673
<v Sochami>There were no differences among us.</v>

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:46.699
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:09:46.699 --> 00:10:09.831
<v Sochami>Jews that were taken away from this place, were killed down the road with submachine guns.</v>

I was able to hid for three days under ground, in a barrack, together with many Russian Christians, who did not know I was a Jew.</v>

00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:10.875
<v Boder>They didn’t know you.</v>

00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:15.704
<v Sochami>They didn’t know if I was a Jew. I always told them I was Greek and Christian.</v>

00:10:15.704 --> 00:10:17.757
<v Boder>Greek and Christian, I see.</v>

00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:34.526
<v Sochami>Then, a couple of days before the Germans left, the Americans arrived. It was about four in the afternoon, in April; April 11, 1945.</v>

00:10:34.526 --> 00:10:35.268
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:41.456
<v Sochami>When I saw the Russians coming out, because we had been hiding, I did not want to go out because I was scared.</v>

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.229
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:10:42.229 --> 00:11:05.969
<v Sochami>Then I saw they were all kissing and embracing each other outside.</v>

I looked and I saw everybody was dancing because the Americans were coming, so I went out.

I weighted only 38 kg because of the famine, and though I was falling down, I started singing and dancing.</v>

00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.866
<v Sochami>Once the Americans arrived, we started eating and drinking well, and I was with the Americans for two months.</v>

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:15.681
<v Boder>Where?</v>

00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:17.009
<v Sochami>In Buchenwald.</v>

600:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Boder>Buchenwald, I see.</v>

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.184
<v Sochami>After two months, we were sent to Paris to be taken to Greece.</v>

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:23.999
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:25.418
<v Sochami>By plane.</v>

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.006
<v Boder>Right.</v>

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:27.899
<v Sochami>[Unintelligible].</v>

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.710
<v Boder>How many people were there on the plane?</v>

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.185
<v Sochami>Only 53 Greek.</v>

00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.388
<v Sochami>And 10 from Salonica.</v>

00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:35.294
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:47.626
<v Sochami>We were taken to Paris, and the rest were sent to Greece.</v>

And since I had served in the French Légion Étrangère from 1920 to 1925, in Morocco...</v>

00:11:47.626 --> 00:11:49.063
<v Boder>Oh. Right. Aha.</v>

00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:53.367
<v Sochami>I had the chance of staying in France.</v>

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:54.683
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:11:54.683 --> 00:12:03.242
<v Sochami>And so I stayed like this for a year because I was really thin.</v>

00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:03.725
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:06.351
<v Sochami>And now, I have started to work.</v>

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.977
<v Boder>And who do you work for now?</v>

00:12:08.977 --> 00:12:10.504
<v Sochami>For an American journal.</v>

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:16.239
<v Boder>OK. And what are you planning to do in the future?</v>

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:26.941
<v Sochami>I don’t know . . . For the time being, I am working here, and as soon as I can find another job to earn my living.</v>

00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.140
<v Boder>Aha. But, are you planning to stay in France?</v>

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.774
<v Sochami>Yes.</v>

00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:31.167
<v Boder>And...</v>

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.746
<v Sochami>May be I will go to Palestine later.</v>

00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.519
<v Sochami>And... as soon as the situation improves.</v>

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Boder>Aha. And what do you do here for the journal? What are you doing now?</v>

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:51.817
<v Sochami>I work here in the [unintelligible], Where they receive heavy boxes. I carry them, I close envelopes... er...</v>

00:12:51.817 --> 00:12:53.719
<v Boder>So you do manual work.</v>

00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:54.854
<v Sochami>Yes. Manual work.</v>

00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:58.252
<v Boder>Do you have family here?</v>

00:12:58.252 --> 00:12:13.554
<v Sochami>Unfortunately, there were 27 members in my family: 3 brothers, one sister with their own families.</v>

And they all ended up in crematories, and I am the only one left in my whole family.</v>

00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:13.886
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Sochami>Out of 27, I am alone in the world.</v>

00:12:16.240 --> 00:13:20.827
<v Boder>And have you written to Greece?</v>

00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:29.127
<v Sochami>Yes. I have written to Greece, but [unintelligible] told me that my brother’s oldest son is alive.</v>

00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:29.688
<v Boder>Pardon me.</v>

00:13:29.688 --> 00:13:34.578
<v Sochami>My brother’s oldest son is still alive.</v>

00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:35.743
<v Boder>So, he is alive.</v>

00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:36.365
<v Sochami>Yes.</v>

00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:36.655
<v Boder>Aha.</v>

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:53.786
<v Sochami>And one of my sister’s daughters... people say they saw her alive with other girls...

but she left with some Belgians, and I have no idea whether she is dead or alive...

I don't know where she is... I was told she was sent to Belgium.</v>

00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:55.977
<v Boder>Oh. Right. She went to Belgium but you are not sure.</v>

00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:58.965
<v Sochami>Yes. I don’t know where [unintelligible].</v>

00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:08.683
<v Boder>Well, monsieur... Sochami. This has been an interesting conversation. I found all you said very interesting. Thank you very much.</v>

00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:30.213
<v Boder>[In English] That ends the report of Henry Sochami. Taking about... taking about twelve minutes of Spool number 43.</v>

We will leave the rest for another interviewee. Muchas gracias.</v>

00:14:30.213 --> 00:15:07.000
<v Boder>Chicago, November the 21st, 1950. This concludes Spool 9-43A of Henry Sochami, it is a spool in Spanish.</v>

The next Spool 9-43B is by a Mr. Mizrahi and seems to be in English. Boder.</v>
