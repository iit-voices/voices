00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:30.563
Henry Sochami: Men and women and children.

86
00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:31.275
David Boder: Right.

87
00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:33.388
Henry Sochami: To the closed railway cars.

88
00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:41.694

92
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:52.789
David Boder: Right.

93
00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.962

94
00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:56.006

Henry Sochami: We got to the station on March 21.

96
00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:00.854
David Boder: Right.

97
00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:05.550

103
00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:22.277
Henry Sochami: Children, women and old people were placed in trucks and sent to Birkenau.

105

Henry Sochami: Birkenau.

106
00:05:23.883 --> 00:05:24.505
David Boder: Right.

107
00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:35.328
Henry Sochami: Once there, they were sent to the gas chamber, directly... almost with no difficulties. The following morning, none of them were alive.

108
00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:37.308
David Boder: Did this happen to your family?

109
00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:42.849

110
00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:43.453
David Boder: Oh.

111
00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:49.266
Henry Sochami: We were then sent to Auschwitz. Once in Auschwitz, we were left in the bathrooms all night long.

112
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:49.797
David Boder: Right.

113
00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:53.811
Henry Sochami: We were washed, our clothes were taken away,

114
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:54.505
David Boder: Right.

115
00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:59.002
Henry Sochami: We were given prisoner’s clothes, and we were placed under quarantine for forty days.

116
00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:00.994
David Boder: What did you do while you were in quarantine?

117
00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:05.733
Henry Sochami: During the quarantine period, we were taken outside to do some physical exercise...

118
00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:06.807
David Boder: Right.

119
00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:18.638
Henry Sochami: And that was it. After the forty days had passed, some officers came to see us. They selected all those men who were strong and working men, and sent them out of Auschwitz, to other labor camps.

120
00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:19.091
David Boder: Right.

121
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.570
Henry Sochami: I stayed in Auschwitz.

123
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.377
David Boder: What happened to those who could not work?

124
00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:31.303
Henry Sochami: Those who could not work were taken to a hospital... er... from the hospital, they were taken to Birkenau, to the crematorium.

125
00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:31.834
David Boder: Right.

126
00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:38.263
Henry Sochami: And as for those of us who could work, we were sent to labor camps or commands nearby.

127
00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:38.945
David Boder: Right.

128
00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:44.106
Henry Sochami: In the commands . . . we were left aside, beaten...

129
00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:44.921
David Boder: Right.

130
00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:49.768
Henry Sochami: And our food was a piece of bread with a liter of water.

131
00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:51.971
David Boder: What command did you work in?

132
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:53.843
Henry Sochami: In the [unintelligible].

133
00:06:53.843 --> 00:06:55.521
David Boder: And what did you do there?

134
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:57.272
Henry Sochami: There, we practiced masonry.

135
00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:57.924
David Boder: What?

136
00:06:57.924 --> 00:06:58.516
Henry Sochami: Masonry.

137
00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:01.009
David Boder: Oh, you cut stone blocks?

138
00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.860
enry Sochami: Yes. Stones... with civilians who worked with us.

139
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.263
David Boder: Right.

140
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:15.985
David Boder: There was a little interruption.

141
00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:27.726
Henry Sochami: A month before the Russians' arrival, the camp was evacuated and we were sent to a camp in [unintelligible name]. In [unintelligible name], there were only forty Jews, and the rest of the prisoners were Christian.

142
00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:29.887
David Boder: Could you please speak a little bit slower?

143
00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:55.608
Henry Sochami: Christians battered us because they could not stand the mere sight of us. They would walk away from us, they would beat us, and they would even take our bread which was our only food. From there, before the Russians came, we were taken to Buchenwald. We were forced in cattle railcars and we were locked there for three days and three nights, with no food and nothing to drink. Nothing.

144
00:07:55.608 --> 0:07:57.962
David Boder: Do you remember what month it was?

145
00:07:57.962 --> 00:08:03.033
Henry Sochami: Er... It was February of 1945.

146
00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:07.035
David Boder: February of 1945. All right.

147
00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:38.126
Henry Sochami: We were taken to Buchenwald. There were sixty five to seventy thousand people under the same roof, from all nationalities, French, Italians... all the nationalities in the world. We were in a building for some time, and then there was a selection and all those who were strong enough were taken to camps all around Germany for forced labors. I would always hid under beds, or anywhere to avoid being taken to labor camps.

148
00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:43.197
David Boder: Oh! So it was possible to hide sometimes, wasn’t it?

149
00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.241
Henry Sochami: It was sometimes possible.

150
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:48.195
David Boder: It was sometimes possible. Speak more slowly please.

151
00:08:48.195 --> 00:09:32.930
Henry Sochami: From there, I was taken to a small camp. In that small camp, I was in a barrack hut with 1,200-1,300 people. There were 7 or 8 people per square meter. At ten in the morning, we were given a liter of water and a piece of bread. Three months later, Americans were approaching and every afternoon Jews were gathered to be taken away. Christians were not taken away, but Jews were. I would hide anywhere, and I even lived among Christians and they did not know I was a Jew.

152
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:38.001
David Boder: Did you carry anything that distinguished you as Jews?

153
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:43.784
Henry Sochami: In Auschwitz, we carried a sign as Jews, but when we were in Buchenwald we did not have anything.

154
00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:44.677
David Boder: OK.

155
00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:45.673
Henry Sochami: There were no differences among us.

156
00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:46.699
David Boder: Right.

157
00:09:46.699 --> 00:10:09.831
Henry Sochami: Jews that were taken away from this place, were killed down the road with submachine guns. I was able to hid for three days under ground, in a barrack, together with many Russian Christians, who did not know I was a Jew.

158
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:10.875
David Boder: They didn’t know you.

159
00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:15.704
Henry Sochami: They didn’t know if I was a Jew. I always told them I was Greek and Christian.

160
00:10:15.704 --> 00:10:17.757
David Boder: Greek and Christian, I see.

161
00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:34.526
Henry Sochami: Then, a couple of days before the Germans left, the Americans arrived. It was about four in the afternoon, in April; April 11, 1945.

162
00:10:34.526 --> 00:10:35.268
David Boder: Right.

163
00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:41.456
Henry Sochami: When I saw the Russians coming out, because we had been hiding, I did not want to go out because I was scared.

164
00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.229
David Boder: Right.

165
00:10:42.229 --> 00:11:05.969
Henry Sochami: Then I saw they were all kissing and embracing each other outside. I looked and I saw everybody was dancing because the Americans were coming, so I went out. I weighted only 38 kg because of the famine, and though I was falling down, I started singing and dancing.

166
00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:07.200
David Boder: Right.

167
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.866
Henry Sochami: Once the Americans arrived, we started eating and drinking well, and I was with the Americans for two months.

168
00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:15.681
David Boder: Where?

169
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:17.009
enry Sochami: In Buchenwald.

170
600:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.790
David Boder: Buchenwald, I see.

171
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.184
Henry Sochami: After two months, we were sent to Paris to be taken to Greece.

172
00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:23.999
David Boder: Right.

173
00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:25.418
Henry Sochami: By plane.

174
00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.006
David Boder: Right.

175
00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:27.899
Henry Sochami: [Unintelligible].

176
00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.710
David Boder: How many people were there on the plane?

178
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.185
Henry Sochami: Only 53 Greek.

179
00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:33.060
David Boder: Aha.

180
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.388
Henry Sochami: And 10 from Salonica.

181
00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:35.294
David Boder: Aha.

182
00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:47.626
Henry Sochami: We were taken to Paris, and the rest were sent to Greece. And since I had served in the French Légion Étrangère from 1920 to 1925, in Morocco...

183
00:11:47.626 --> 00:11:49.063
David Boder: Oh. Right. Aha.

184
00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:53.367
Henry Sochami: I had the chance of staying in France.

185
00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:54.683
David Boder: Aha.

186
00:11:54.683 --> 00:12:03.242
Henry Sochami: And so I stayed like this for a year because I was really thin.

187
00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:03.725
David Boder: Aha.

188
00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:06.351
Henry Sochami: And now, I have started to work.

189
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.977
David Boder: And who do you work for now?

190
00:12:08.977 --> 00:12:10.504
Henry Sochami: For an American journal.

191
00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:16.239
David Boder: OK. And what are you planning to do in the future?

192
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:26.941
Henry Sochami: I don’t know . . . For the time being, I am working here, and as soon as I can find another job to earn my living.

193
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.140
David Boder: Aha. But, are you planning to stay in France?

194
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.774
Henry Sochami: Yes.

195
00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:31.167
David Boder: And...

196
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.746
Henry Sochami: May be I will go to Palestine later.

197
00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:35.350
David Boder: Aha.

198
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.519
Henry Sochami: And... as soon as the situation improves.

199
00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:43.590
David Boder: Aha. And what do you do here for the journal? What are you doing now?

200
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:51.817
Henry Sochami: I work here in the [unintelligible], Where they receive heavy boxes. I carry them, I close envelopes... er...

201
00:12:51.817 --> 00:12:53.719
David Boder: So you do manual work.

202
00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:54.854
Henry Sochami: Yes. Manual work.

203
00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:58.252
David Boder: Do you have family here?

204
00:12:58.252 --> 00:12:13.554
Henry Sochami: Unfortunately, there were 27 members in my family: 3 brothers, one sister with their own families. And they all ended up in crematories, and I am the only one left in my whole family.

205
00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:13.886
David Boder: Aha.

206
00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:16.240
Henry Sochami: Out of 27, I am alone in the world.

207
00:12:16.240 --> 00:13:20.827
David Boder: And have you written to Greece?

208
00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:29.127
Henry Sochami: Yes. I have written to Greece, but [unintelligible] told me that my brother’s oldest son is alive.

209
00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:29.688
David Boder: Pardon me.

210
00:13:29.688 --> 00:13:34.578
Henry Sochami: My brother’s oldest son is still alive.

211
00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:35.743
David Boder: So, he is alive.

212
00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:36.365
Henry Sochami: Yes.

213
00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:36.655
David Boder: Aha.

214
00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:53.786
Henry Sochami: And one of my sister’s daughters... people say they saw her alive with other girls... but she left with some Belgians, and I have no idea whether she is dead or alive... I don't know where she is... I was told she was sent to Belgium.

215
00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:55.977
David Boder: Oh. Right. She went to Belgium but you are not sure.

216
00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:58.965
Henry Sochami: Yes. I don’t know where [unintelligible].

217
00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:08.683
David Boder: Well, monsieur... Sochami. This has been an interesting conversation. I found all you said very interesting. Thank you very much.

218
00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:30.213
David Boder: [In English] That ends the report of Henry Sochami. Taking about... taking about twelve minutes of Spool number 43. We will leave the rest for another interviewee. Muchas gracias.

219
00:14:30.213 --> 00:15:07.000
David Boder: Chicago, November the 21st, 1950. This concludes Spool 9-43A of Henry Sochami, it is a spool in Spanish. The next Spool 9-43B is by a Mr. Mizrahi and seems to be in English. Boder.
